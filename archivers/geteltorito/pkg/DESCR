geteltorito will extract the initial/default boot image from a CD if
existant. It will not extract any of other possibly existing bootimages
that are allowed by the El Torito standard.
The imagedata are written to STDOUT all other information is written to
STDERR (eg type and size of image).
If you want to write the image to a file instead of STDOUT you can
secify the filename wanted on the commandline using option -o <filename>

call: 	 geteltorito CD-image > toritoimagefile
example: geteltorito /dev/cd0c  > /tmp/bootimage
