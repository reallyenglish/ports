xorriso copies file objects from POSIX compliant filesystems into Rock
Ridge enhanced ISO 9660 filesystems and allows session-wise manipulation
of such filesystems. It can load the management information of existing
ISO images and it writes the session results to optical media or to
filesystem objects.
