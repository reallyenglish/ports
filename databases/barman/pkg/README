Config
======

Configure the main section in ${SYSCONFDIR}/barman.conf for the
database(s) you want barman to backup.

Cron Job
========

Put the following in _barman's crontab

# crontab -u _barman -l
0	*	*	*	*	${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/barman cron
54	0	*	*	*	${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/barman backup all

The first job performs maintenance tasks, such as moving incoming WAL
files to the appropriate directory.
The second job performs the actual backup.
