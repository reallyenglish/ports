Dieharder is a random number generator (rng) testing suite. It is
intended to test generators, not files of possibly random numbers.

dieharder is a tool designed to permit one to push a weak generator to
unambiguous failure (at the e.g. 0.0001% level), not leave one in the
"limbo" of 1% or 5% maybe-failure. It also contains many tests and is
extensible so that eventually it will contain many more tests than it
already does.
