Memcached relies on SASL as authentication mechanisms, if you could not
use it, it should be firewalled accordingly. You may wish
to add a rule such as the following to /etc/pf.conf:

  block on $ext_if proto tcp to ($ext_if) port 11211

An alternative is to listen on a unix socket in /var/run/memcached/sock,
granting write permissions to users in group _memcached.

#rcctl set memcached flags '-u _memcached -s /var/run/memcached/sock -a 0660'
