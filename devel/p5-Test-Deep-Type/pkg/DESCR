This is a Test::Deep plugin that provides the sub is_type to indicate
that the data being tested must validate against the passed type.
This is an actual type object, not a string name -- for example
something provided via MooseX::Types, or a plain old coderef that
returns a bool (such as what might be used in a Moo type constraint)
