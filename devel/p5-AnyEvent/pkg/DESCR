AnyEvent provides a uniform interface to various event loops.  This
allows module authors to use event loop functionality without forcing
module users to use a specific event loop implementation (since
more than one event loop cannot coexist peacefully).  The interface
itself is vaguely similar, but not identical to the Event module.
