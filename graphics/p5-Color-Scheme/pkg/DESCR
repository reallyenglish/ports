This module is a Perl implementation of Color Schemes 2
(http://wellstyled.com/tools/colorscheme2/), a color scheme generator.
Start by visitng the Color Schemes 2 web site and playing with the
colors.  When you want to generate those schemes on the fly, begin
using this module.  The descriptions herein don't make too much
sense without actually seeing the colorful results.
