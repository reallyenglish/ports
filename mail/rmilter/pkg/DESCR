Obsolete software to integrate rspamd with any milter-compatible MTA, for
example postfix or sendmail.

Do not use rmilter in new projects. You should work to move existing
installations across to rspamd's integrated milter support.

This package is being maintained in the short time to ease transition,
but will be removed.
