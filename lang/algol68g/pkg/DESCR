The Algol 68 Genie project preserves and promotes Algol 68 out of
educational as well as scientific-historical interest, by making
available a recent checkout compiler-interpreter written from scratch
together with extensive documentation for both the language and this new
implementation. Algol 68 Genie is a fast compiler-interpreter which
ranks among the most complete implementations of the language.
