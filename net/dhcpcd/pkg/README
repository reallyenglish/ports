DHCPv6-PD (Prefix Delegation)
=============================
As OpenBSD doesn't yet support DHCPv6 in the base OS, one common use of
this package is to request Prefix Delegation from an ISP, which hands you
one or more routable IPv6 subnet that can be assigned to interfaces
facing your local network.

Here is a sample configuration achieving this, fetching addresses over the
pppoe0 interface and assigning it to multiple local networks.

-- -- -- -- -- --
ipv6only
duid
persistent
option rapid_commit
require dhcp_server_identifier

# disable running any hooks; not typically required for simple DHCPv6-PD setup
script /usr/bin/true

# Disable dhcpcd's own router solicitation support; allow the kernel
# to do this instead by setting "inet6 autoconf" in hostname.pppoe0
noipv6rs

# List interfaces explicitly so that dhcpcd doesn't touch others
allowinterfaces pppoe0 em0 vlan3 vlan5

interface pppoe0
	# request prefix delegation for downstream interfaces.
	ia_pd 2 em0/1 vlan3/2 vlan5/3
-- -- -- -- -- --

In normal cases, you would use rtadvd(8) to advertise these prefixes to
clients (e.g. "rcctl enable rtadvd; rcctl set rtadvd flags em0 vlan3 vlan5").
