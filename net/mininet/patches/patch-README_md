 Mininet: Rapid Prototyping for Software Defined Networks

+This is a heavily refactored version of Mininet that also supports
+FreeBSD and OpenBSD, and attempts to make it easier to add support for
+non-Linux systems. As such, the native install instructions are
+slightly different. This is also a heavy work-in-progress so things
+may be broken or unsupported.

-### How does it work?
 
-Mininet creates virtual networks using process-based virtualization
-and network namespaces - features that are available in recent Linux
-kernels.  In Mininet, hosts are emulated as `bash` processes running in
-a network namespace, so any code that would normally run on a Linux
-server (like a web server or client program) should run just fine
-within a Mininet "Host".  The Mininet "Host" will have its own private
-network interface and can only see its own processes.  Switches in
-Mininet are software-based switches like Open vSwitch or the OpenFlow
-reference switch.  Links are virtual ethernet pairs, which live in the
-Linux kernel and connect our emulated switches to emulated hosts
-(processes).

-- OVS patch links have been implemented via OVSLink and --link ovs
 
-  Warning! These links have *serious limitations* compared to
-  virtual Ethernet pairs: they are not attached to real Linux
-  interfaces so you cannot use tcpdump or wireshark with them;
-  they also cannot be used in long chains - we don't recommend more
-  than 64 OVSLinks, for example --linear,64. However, they can offer
-  significantly better performance than veth pairs, for certain
-  configurations.

-- You can now easily install Mininet on a Raspberry Pi ;-)
