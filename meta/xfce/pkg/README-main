| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Xfce desktop is composed of 2 meta-packages:
    * xfce, for a base Xfce installation
    * xfce-extras, for a full Xfce installation.

Startup
=======
Xfce desktop environment is launched through the 'startxfce4' script.
Simply add '${LOCALBASE}/bin/startxfce4' to your .xinitrc/.xsession
script if you use startx, xdm or slim.
If you use gdm or kdm, have a look at
http://wiki.xfce.org/faq#starting_xfce. An xfce4.desktop file is
provided for use by gdm.

Logging out and shutting down the computer
==========================================
If your installation supports complete shutdown, clicking on the logout
button on panel will permit you to either logout, rebooting or halt
the computer.

Halting and rebooting require consolekit2 and polkit: you'll need to run
a systemwide D-BUS service (add messagebus to pkg_scripts in
rc.conf.local) and pass --with-ck-launch argument to startxfce4. If you
run a systemwide D-BUS service, have consolekit2/polkit installed and
don't use --with-ck-launch you will not be able to shutdown/reboot.

Power management
================
If you use Xfce on a laptop, you can install xfce4-power-manager
package, which will provide battery levels/information, and will allow
to configure actions upon low battery level or AC plugging. If using
consolekit2 and polkit, it will also allow you to suspend the laptop
from the logout dialog.

Screensaver management
======================
xflock4 can make use of xscreensaver or gnome-screensaver. If installed,
a 'Screensaver' icon will appear in settings manager/menu. Otherwise,
xflock4 defaults to call xlock.

Thunar file manager tips
========================
If you want to browse samba shares using GVfs, you'll need to install
gvfs-smb package. You can also try gigolo package, which is a GUI to
configure GVfs mounts.

Terminal, special characters and localized applications
=======================================================
If you use a particular non-ascii encoding and have problems seeing
special characters in terminal (like accentued characters in french),
you should add this line to your .xinitrc/.xsession before startxfce4:

export LC_CTYPE=fr_FR.ISO8859-15

where LC_CTYPE is defined by <language>_<country>.<encoding>.

Similarly, if you want localized graphical applications, add this line
too:

export LC_MESSAGES=fr

where 'fr' is your language tag.
See http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq10.html#locales for more information
on that topic.

More generally, http://wiki.xfce.org/faq and http://wiki.xfce.org/tips
are the best resources for user-level documentation.
