LIDAR sensors quickly produce millions of points with large numbers of
variables measured on each point. The challenge for a point cloud database
extension is efficiently storing this data while allowing high fidelity access
to the many variables stored.

PostgreSQL Pointcloud deals with all this variability by using a "schema
document" to describe the contents of any particular LIDAR point. Each point
contains a number of dimensions, and each dimension can be of any data type,
with scaling and/or offsets applied to move between the actual value and the
value stored in the database. The schema document format used by PostgreSQL
Pointcloud is the same one used by the [PDAL](http://pointcloud.org) library.
