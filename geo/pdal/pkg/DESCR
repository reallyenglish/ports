PDAL is a C++ BSD library for translating and manipulating point cloud
data. It is very much like the GDAL library which handles raster and
vector data.

In addition to the library code, PDAL provides a suite of command-line
applications that users can conveniently use to process, filter,
translate, and query point cloud data.
