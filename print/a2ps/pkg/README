| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

a2ps(1) uses external helper commands to convert files to PostScript.

Because usage and needs can be different from one installation to the
other, none of these commands are enforced as a dependency of this
package and it is up the administrator to decide which convertion tool
is needed.

They can be configured under ${SYSCONFDIR}/a2ps{,-site}.cfg.

By default, images are converted using the convert(1) utility from the
ImageMagick package.

When using cups(1), lp.default should be set to ${LOCALBASE}/bin/lpr in
${SYSCONFDIR}/a2ps-site.cfg.
