EncFS provides an encrypted filesystem based on FUSE and OpenSSL.

EncFS works on a per-file basis, not with entire block devices.
An EncFS filesystem can grow to any size without being reformatted
and can be backed-up on a file-by-file basis.

EncFS does NOT encrypt or otherwise hide the following information:
 - The number of files you have encrypted
 - The permissions on the files (readable, writable, executable)
 - The size of each file
 - The approximate size of each filename (to within 16 bytes using AES,
   or 8 bytes using Blowfish)
