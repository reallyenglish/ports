ZKT (Zone Key Tool) manages keys and signatures for DNSSEC-zones.
It consists of four commands:

zkt-conf, to manage the config file
zkt-ls, to list dnssec zone keys
zkt-keyman, to manage dnssec zone keys manually (seldom used)
zkt-signer, to sign a zone and manage the lifetime and rollover of the
zone signing keys

Most of the commands are simple wrapper commands around BIND's
dnssec-keygen(8) and dnssec-signzone(8) commands.
