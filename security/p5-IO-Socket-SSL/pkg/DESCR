IO::Socket::SSL makes using SSL/TLS much easier by wrapping the
necessary functionality into the familiar IO::Socket interface and
providing secure defaults whenever possible.  This way, existing
applications can be made SSL-aware without much effort, at least
if you do blocking I/O and don't use select or poll.
