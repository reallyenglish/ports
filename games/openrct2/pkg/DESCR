OpenRCT2 is an open source re-implementation of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2
and the original RollerCoaster Tycoon, construction and management
simulation games that simulate amusement park management. You can also
build your own roller coasters.

OpenRCT2 requires game files from RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 in order to
work properly. It will also use files from the original RollerCoaster
Tycoon if available.
