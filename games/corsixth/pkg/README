CorsixTH
========
CorsixTH requires the original game files from Theme Hospital to work
properly.  These can come from an original CD or from GOG.com.

CorsixTH will ask you for the location of the game files on first
launch. Point CorsixTH to the directory on your hard drive containing
these files.

If using the GOG.com version, you must extract the files from
setup_theme_hospital_1.0.0.4.exe using archivers/innoextract. The files
will be in a directory named app. You must keep this directory, though
it can be renamed and moved to a location of your choosing, and you can
delete everything else that is extracted from the exe, such as the tmp
directory.
